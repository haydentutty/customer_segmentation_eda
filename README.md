# customer_segmentation_eda
An exploratory analysis of a customer segmentation dataset. 
#As I explore a customer dataset - I wanted to go through all the classic data cleaning available in Python as well as draw soem insights before convering my findings
into a dahsboard. I have found that data cleaning and modeling can help direct my dahsboards and obviously make the data easier to work with once in tableau.
